# Objective-C and [Logos](https://github.com/DHowett/logos) language support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to Objective-C and Logos files in Atom.

Originally [converted](http://atom.io/docs/latest/converting-a-text-mate-bundle)
from the [Objective-C TextMate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/objective-c.tmbundle), then forked over to here.

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a
pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
